To setup spark on AWS EC2 instance
First we need to make sure we are SSH'd into our EC2 Instance 

Then we install Python

sudo pip3 yum install python 

sudo pip3 yum install jupyter 

pwd -> To print/see our current working directory 

wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-3.0.1/spark-3.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz  -> To install the current spark agent 

 sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem

 /home/ec2-user/spark-3.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7
